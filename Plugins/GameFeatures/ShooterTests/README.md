## Plugin Overview

The scope of this document is to only cover the **Shooter Tests** plugin. For a more generalized guide to plugins, including how to create a new plugin or enabling/disabling existing plugins, please see [the online documentation on plugins](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/plugins-in-unreal-engine) for more information.

This section provides an overview of the plugin. The plugin comes bundled as part of the **Lyra** starter content which can be downloaded from [the Epic Games Launcher](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine) and can be found in `/LyraStarterGame/Plugins/GameFeatures/ShooterTests`. The underlying sections below will go into further detail about different aspects of the plugin. Specifics include: the structure of the plugin, how to enable the plugin for use within Lyra, and how to run the tests packaged with the plugin.

### Plugin Structure

Below is the general document structure of the plugin

```

            └── Private/
```

The focus and scope of this document will be on the `Content` and `Source` directories as this will be where the tests and resources needed for tests will reside. For example, the [Blueprint Functional Tests](#blueprint-functional-tests) will have a Blueprint class for the test stored within the `Blueprint` directory, but the map that loads the Blueprint asset will be found in the `Map` directory. While it seems that the pieces of the test are scattered within the plugin, they all reside in the appropriate folder as some assets are reused in other tests. It's best practice to split up your components and organize them in a way that makes sense as opposed to bundling all pieces of a test together as the latter can lead to duplication of assets and a larger plugin size.

### How to run tests provided by the plugin

This section requires knowledge about the **Automation System** and how to navigate the **Automation** tab of the **Session Frontend** to find and execute tests. Please see [the online documentation on the Automation System](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/automation-system-user-guide-in-unreal-engine) for more information. With the **Session Frontend** opened to the **Automation** tab, we can navigate to `Project -> Functional Tests -> Shooter Tests` in order to get to the tests currently packaged within the plugin. These tests can also be reached by using the **Search** bar on top and using the keyword **ShooterTests** to filter out and only show the tests in this plugin. See the section immediately below for more detailed explanation on what types of tests are included and what is being tested.

## Tests Within the Plugin

The plugin demonstrates tests using either Blueprint or code. This section describes various tests packaged with the plugin.

* [CQTests](#cqtests)
* [Blueprint Functional Tests](#blueprint-functional-tests)

### CQTests

**CQTest**, or Code Quality Tests, are a method of creating functional tests using C++. The **CQTest** framework is an Unreal Engine module and is enabled within **ShooterTests**. Unreal Engine provides multiple testing frameworks, but the focus on CQTest was decided due to providing before/after functionality that is paired with each test case. Another benefit is that **CQTest** resets the state of each test automatically, making sure that each test is atomic in that there is no worry about leaking objects to or from another test. Please refer to the readme documentation located in `/Engine/Source/Developer/CQTest` for a deeper understanding of **CQTest**.

**Shooter Tests** are tests implemented using the **CQTest** framework within their respective categories. Within the categories, it's possible to have subcategories to help further define the type or functionality expected to be tested. While [Blueprint Functional Tests](#blueprint-functional-tests) are categorized in the **Automation** tab by the map that they reside in. Similar to how clicking on a [Blueprint Functional Tests](#blueprint-functional-tests) will load the level with the Functional Test Actor, clicking on a **CQTest** will open the code file where the test is implemented.

Tests created using the **CQTest** framework allows for custom categorization when declaring the `TEST_CLASS` or `TEST` itself. For example

```
TEST(SimpleTest, "Project.Functional Tests.ShooterTests.Tests")
{
    ASSERT_THAT(IsTrue(true));
}
```

will show an item labeled `SimpleTest` under `Project -> Functional Tests -> ShooterTests -> Tests` within the **Automation** tab. More information about the **CQTest** framework is documented in the readme mentioned above and the examples outlined below.

Here are the current categories and subcategories of the tests within the plugin:

* **Actor**
  * **Animation**
    * [InputCrouchAnimationTest](#inputcrouchanimationtest)
    * [WeaponMeleeAnimationTest](#weaponmeleeanimationtest)
  * **Replication**
    * [InputAnimationTest](#inputanimationtest)
* **GameplayAbility**
  * [AbilitySpawnerMapTest](#abilityspawnermaptest)

#### CQTest Prerequisites

Please note that the [InputCrouchAnimationTest](#inputcrouchanimationtest), [WeaponMeleeAnimationTest](#weaponmeleeanimationtest), and [InputAnimationTest](#inputanimationtest) below follows a custom implementation of the `TEST_CLASS`. **CQTest** provides the following macros when creating tests:

* `TEST`
* `TEST_CLASS`
* `TEST_CLASS_WITH_BASE`
* `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS`
* `TEST_CLASS_WITH_BASE_AND_FLAGS`
* `TEST_METHOD`

The Animation tests use the above to create 2 new macros:

* `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST`
  * Wraps the `TEST_CLASS_WITH_BASE` macro specifying the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` as the base struct.
* `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST_WITH_FLAGS`
  * Wraps the `TEST_CLASS_WITH_BASE_AND_FLAGS` macro specifying the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` as the base struct.

The Replication test also uses the above to create its own macro:

* `ACTOR_ANIMATION_NETWORK_TEST`
  * Wraps the `TEST_CLASS_WITH_BASE_AND_FLAGS` macro specifying the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` as the base struct and specifies the flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter` as these tests cannot run outside of the Editor.

Both the `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` and `ShooterTestsActorNetworkTest` inherits from `public TTest<Derived, AsserterType>` which is a templated object that setups up the structure of an Automated Test. More information about the structure and information about the core of **CQTest** can be found in the README document within the root directory of the **CQTest** Engine plugin. By inheriting from `TTest` we gain all of the functionality that allows for the tests to be registered and executed, while being able to expand on the functionality that would be shared by the specific tests.

#### Animation Test Prerequisites

There are also tests that inherit from the above mentioned objects to further expand the functionality needed for testing. The newly defined `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST` macros take in a new user defined class called `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` which has been created to help with testing the animation functionality as `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` is derived from `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`. The reason being is similar to how we have a category of tests for an `Actor` with a subcategory of `Animation`, we also have a base class for the Actor called `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` with `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` being derived. This way we can keep the members needed for animations separate from tests that just need or will expand upon the Actor.

To use our newly defined `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST` macros, we need to specify `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` as the base class, but if `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` is derived from `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`, how do we exactly create a base class to then be used in our macro? If we focus on either `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` we can see that these classes inherit from `public TTest<Derived, AsserterType>` which is a templated object. From there we can create the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` object which derives from `public ShooterTestsActorBaseTest<Derived, AsserterType>`, again with the template specified. With this we can now have our `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` object which provides access and functionality to the animation tests as well as providing functionality from `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` for our Actor.

The animation tests make use of helper functionality provided by `ShooterTestsAnimationTestHelper` and `ShooterTestsInputTestHelper`.

**ShooterTestsAnimationTestHelper**
The `ShooterTestsAnimationTestHelper` object that exists in this file aids in finding `UAnimationAsset` objects and checking if the asset is playing. The object has methods which require the `USkeletalMeshComponent` in order to retrieve animation assets and information. `FindAnimationAsset` will search through the `USkeletalMeshComponent` to make sure that an asset with the same name exists within the component. `IsAnimationPlaying` iterates through all of the animation instances of the `USkeletalMeshComponent` before checking any active montages and sync groups for the expected animation to be playing.

**ShooterTestsInputTestHelper**
Within this file are multiple input objects that the **Lyra** player has access to. We have multiple `FTestAction` objects for each `Input Action` that is tested against. Currently the following `Input Actions` are implemented and being handled:

* `FToggleCrouchTestAction`
* `FMeleeTestAction`
* `FJumpTestAction`
* `FMoveTestAction`
* `FLookTestAction`

In addition to the actions mentioned above, both `FMoveTestAction` and `FLookTestAction` have additional derived objects to handle the different directions along the 2D axis. These include:

* `FMoveForwardTestAction`
* `FMoveBackwardTestAction`
* `FStrafeLeftTestAction`
* `FStrafeRightTestAction`
* `FRotateLeftTestAction`
* `FRotateRightTestAction`

While the **Lyra** player has more `Input Actions` available, these are what are currently handled based on the current test coverage and more will be added as more tests are created.

To be able to trigger all these `Input Actions` the `FShooterTestsPawnTestActions` object extends from `FInputTestActions` to specify each action that will be performed. While all the input follows the same flow of calling `PerformAction` on a `FTestAction` object, we expand upon the actions to make the tests more descriptive as to what is tested against and what is expected to happen.

#### InputCrouchAnimationTest

**Please see the section above about [Animation Test Prerequisites](#animation-test-prerequisites) before going deeper into this section as there are custom implementations of base **CQTest** functionality that may cause confusion.**

The **InputCrouchAnimationTest** is a test object created from the macro `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST` and the implementation can be found in `/ShooterTests/Source/ShooterTestsRuntime/Private/ShooterTestsActorAnimationTests.cpp`. These test that the expected animations are played during certain movement actions while crouched. 

The breakdown of the implementation is as follows:
We create our test object with the `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST` macro and the parameters `InputCrouchAnimationTest` and `"Project.Functional Tests.ShooterTests.Actor.Animation"`. As mentioned in the [CQTest Prerequisites](#cqtest-prerequisites), the macro creates our test object with a `TTestRunner` and an instance of the `InputCrouchAnimationTest`. Because the macro uses `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` as our base object, which is also derived from `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`, we get access to all of the member variables and methods provided by these objects. This will allow us to create our `TEST_METHOD` without the need to setup the `PlayerController` or any other components as the `BEFORE_EACH` will handle that for us.

The `InputCrouchAnimationTest` constructor is defined as a way to call the base object's constructor with an initializer list to provide the directory where the map to load is located and the name of the map to load. This is due to the fact that the `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` will create an instance of a `FMapTestSpawner`. This object handles loading of maps whenever `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::Setup()` is called.

`BEFORE_EACH` goes through and prepares the level for the test as the macro has defined a `virtual void Setup() override` which is what allows the call to `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::Setup();` to be made. `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::Setup();` actually calls the base object's `Setup`, which in this case will be `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`. What the setup will then do is start loading the map that was specified in the Constructor and waits until the level has been loaded.

**Note that while the level has been loaded and marked for use, the actual assets may not have fully populated within the level yet.**

The `TestCommandBuilder` is then used to build the steps needed to ensure that the level is setup prior to the test.

* Wait before starting until the map has been initialized and a player `Pawn` has been found for use. This step defaults to a timeout of 10 seconds, but we increase the timeout to 30 seconds to take into account additional loading done via the loading screen.
* Then, with the `Pawn` loaded a call to `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` is made, which also calls `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::PreparePlayerPawn()`
  * `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` handles setting up the main player and functionality tied to the player which will be used in a later step when determining if the player has fully spawned in.
  * `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` handles setting up functionality tied to testing animations.
* With the functionality now setup, we wait until the player is deemed as being fully spawned. This is done because there is a `GameplayEffect` tied to the player which is triggered on spawn. This effect toggles the input handling which could impact tests as we need input to trigger our animations.

At this point we are in the `BEFORE_EACH` of the **InputCrouchAnimationTest** which will again use the `TestCommandBuilder` to continue building on our steps from our base `Setup` now that the player and animation functionality is setup and loaded. The steps here will get the player to be crouched since each `TEST_METHOD` needs the player in this state to continue.

* Do, a command which will get the animation for `MM_Pistol_Crouch_Idle` to be tested against
* Then, trigger the crouch `Input Action` to be executed
* Wait until the player is crouched and playing the expected animation retrieved in the above step

With the `BEFORE_EACH` now setup to be performed before each of our `TEST_METHOD`, we can create all the tests which will verify that the correct animation is playing for each `Input Action`. Because there are multiple tests within the object that all perform the same test flow, but differ in the expected animation to be playing and the `Input Action` needed to be triggered, the method `TestInputActionAnimation` has been implemented as part of the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` object to perform the flow needed with the different parameters. The method fetches the `UAnimationAsset` from the name of the animation before continuing building upon the `TestCommandBuilder`

* Do, the specified input command
* Wait until the expected animation is playing as this can occur over multiple ticks

#### WeaponMeleeAnimationTest

**Please see the section above about [Animation Test Prerequisites](#animation-test-prerequisites) before going deeper into this section as there are custom implementations of base **CQTest** functionality that may cause confusion.**

The **WeaponMeleeAnimationTest** is a test object created from the macro `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST_WITH_FLAGS` and the implementation can be found in `/ShooterTests/Source/ShooterTestsRuntime/Private/ShooterTestsActorAnimationTests.cpp`. These test that the expected animations are played during certain movement actions while the player has certain weapons equipped. 

The breakdown of the implementation is as follows:
We create our test object with the `ACTOR_ANIMATION_TEST_WITH_FLAGS` macro and the parameters `InputCrouchAnimationTest`, `"Project.Functional Tests.ShooterTests.Actor.Animation"`, and we specify the flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter`. As mentioned in the [CQTest Prerequisites](#cqtest-prerequisites), the macro creates our test object with a `TTestRunner` and an instance of the `InputCrouchAnimationTest`. Because the macro uses `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest` as our base object, which is also derived from `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`, we get access to all of the member variables and methods provided by these objects. This will allow us to create our `TEST_METHOD` without the need to setup the `PlayerController` or any other components as the `BEFORE_EACH` will handle that for us. Because these tests are also spawning items to be used, we specify the flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter` to only run these tests within the Editor context.

The **WeaponMeleeAnimationTest** object has additional variables specified to be use.

* `FCQTestBlueprintHelper` will assist with finding Blueprints for the objects which be used to create our `ALyraWeaponSpawner* WeaponSpawnerPad`.
* `WeaponSpawnerPad` will create the weapons for the `Pawn` to pickup and equip for the tests to then perform a melee `Input Action` to trigger an animation to play and be tested against.

The `WeaponMeleeAnimationTest` constructor is defined as a way to call the base object's constructor with an initializer list to provide the directory where the map to load is located and the name of the map to load. This is due to the fact that the `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest` will create an instance of a `FMapTestSpawner`. This object handles loading of maps whenever `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::Setup()` is called.

Even though we don't specify it, the `BEFORE_EACH` of our base object goes through and prepares the level for the test as the macro has defined a `virtual void Setup() override` which is what allows the call to `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::Setup();` to be made. `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::Setup();` actually calls the base object's `Setup`, which in this case will be `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest`. What the setup will then do is start loading the map that was specified in the Constructor and waits until the level has been loaded.

**Note that while the level has been loaded and marked for use, the actual assets may not have fully populated within the level yet.**

The `TestCommandBuilder` is then used to build the steps needed to ensure that the level is setup prior to the test.

* Wait before starting until the map has been initialized and a player `Pawn` has been found for use. This step defaults to a timeout of 10 seconds, but we increase the timeout to 30 seconds to take into account additional loading done via the loading screen.
* Then, with the `Pawn` loaded a call to `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` is made, which also calls `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::PreparePlayerPawn()`
  * `ShooterTestsActorBaseTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` handles setting up the main player and functionality tied to the player which will be used in a later step when determining if the player has fully spawned in.
  * `ShooterTestsActorAnimationTest::PreparePlayerPawn()` handles setting up functionality tied to testing animations.
* With the functionality now setup, we wait until the player is deemed as being fully spawned. This is done because there is a `GameplayEffect` tied to the player which is triggered on spawn. This effect toggles the input handling which could impact tests as we need input to trigger our animations.

Each `TEST_METHOD`, while tests the same flow, tests with different weapons equipped to make sure that the correct animation is playing. We are testing against 3 distinct weapons each with their own distinct melee animation. Each test will call the `EquipSpawnedWeapon` which takes in 3 parameters, the directory where the asset can be found, the name of the asset which stores the data to be loaded, and the name of the weapon once created and equipped. The method will call the `SpawnWeaponSpawnerPad` method, which takes in the first 2 of the supplied parameters, to use the `FCQTestBlueprintHelper::GetBlueprintClass` to find our `UClass` of the `ALyraWeaponSpawner` to be spawned. We also call `FCQTestBlueprintHelper::FindDataBlueprint` to get our `ULyraWeaponPickupDefinition` of the weapon instance that will be supplied as a parameter for the `ALyraWeaponSpawner`. With the objects found from `FCQTestBlueprintHelper`, the `TObjectBuilder` is then used to create an instance of the `ALyraWeaponSpawner` to be spawned right under the player `Pawn` with the `WeaponDefinition` parameter set to spawn the desired weapon specified by the test.

Using the `TestCommandBuilder`, we build our steps to start testing that the expected weapon is equipped by the player `Pawn`. This is done by checking the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent` against the first `ULyraWeaponInstance`, which will be our currently equipped weapon. We also make sure that the equipped weapon matches the expected name of the weapon instance so that we're not testing against a weapon that we're not expecting and that the functionality of equipping a newly spawned weapon is expected. Once we have made sure that the expected weapon is equipped, we can then add the steps to the steps to the `TestCommandBuilder` to perform our melee `Input Action` before waiting to make sure that the correct animation montage was played.

#### Replication Test Prerequisites

To use the newly defined `ACTOR_ANIMATION_NETWORK_TEST` macro, we need to specify `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` as the base class. Note that the network replication tests follow a similar setup to the stand-alone animation tests above where there is a base `ShooterTestsActorNetworkTest` that `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` derives from. The way the macro is used for the network tests is slightly different as we have more than just a single player to work with. Both the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` and the base `ShooterTestsActorNetworkTest` make use of a `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` which also handles a `FShooterTestsNetworkState` to keep track of both the server and client states. Because the `FShooterTestsNetworkState` requires knowledge of the Actors, instead of the Actor information being tied to the test, reference the [stand-alone animation tests](#animation-test-prerequisites) above. Both the `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` and `FShooterTestsNetworkState` are templated to take in the Actor used for the test.

**FShooterTestsNetworkState**
The `FShooterTestsNetworkState` struct is used to manage both the server and client state in relation to their PIE session. Currently this includes a `UWorld` for the PIE session as both the server and client will have different `UWorld` instances even though it will be the same map. The server `UWorld` will have a valid `APlayerController` for all players, regardless of whether they are local or network connected. On the client `UWorld`, there will only be a single `APlayerController` and that is for the `ULocalPlayer`. The other `ALyraCharacter` instances are `APawn` which get their movement and actions replicated from the server. The `FShooterTestsNetworkState` also keeps a pointer to both the local player and the network connected player for easy access needed for testing, instead of traversing through the `UWorld` of each. The local and network players make use of a `FShooterTestsActorTestHelper` which is an Actor helper object.

**FShooterTestsNetworkComponent**
The `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` is the main component which handles the creation of the PIE sessions and the network between them. The component also handles queuing of latent commands for both the server and client PIE sessions. Similar to how the `TestCommandBuilder` has steps for `Then` and `Until`, the `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` extends those steps and makes them available for both server, `ThenServer` and `UntilServer`, and the client, `ThenClient` and `UntilClient`. This component is templated and requires a type of `FShooterTestsActorTestHelper` to be provided so that both the component and `FShooterTestsNetworkState` can then use the Actor functionality needed for testing. The final step before being able to use the component is to call `Start` as this will then trigger the creation of the server and client PIE sessions, before configuring the network and making sure that both the server and client players are fully spawned into each session.

**FShooterTestsActorTestHelper**
As mentioned in both the `FShooterTestsNetworkState` and `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent`, this is the helper object which wraps around the `ALyraCharacter` to provide commonly used functionality for testing. The wrapped object handles fetching the `USkeletalMeshComponent` as well as the `ULyraAbilitySystemComponent` which can then be used to check when the player is fully spawned into the level or to determine if an animation is currently playing. The underlying functionality is no different than what is being performed in the [InputCrouchAnimationTest](#inputcrouchanimationtest) above, but it made sense to consolidate this information into a shared object as the networking replication tests work on multiple players.

**FShooterTestsActorInputTestHelper**
Object derived from the above `FShooterTestsActorTestHelper` to get all of the main `ALyraCharacter` functionality, but also makes use of `FShooterTestsPawnTestActions` to perform input actions on the player. To make performing input for the tests easier, there is an `enum class` which maps to the type of input that is performed.

#### InputAnimationTest

**Please see the section above about [Replication Test Prerequisites](#replication-test-prerequisites) before going deeper into this section as there are custom implementations of base **CQTest** functionality that may cause confusion.**

The **InputAnimationTest** is a test object created from the macro `ACTOR_ANIMATION_NETWORK_TEST` and the implementation can be found in `/ShooterTests/Source/ShooterTestsRuntime/Private/ShooterTestsActorNetworkTests.cpp`. These test that the expected animations are played during certain movement actions and replicated properly across the network. 

The breakdown of the implementation is as follows:
We create our test object with the `ACTOR_ANIMATION_NETWORK_TEST` macro and the parameters `InputAnimationTest` and `"Project.Functional Tests.ShooterTests.Actor.Replication"`. As mentioned in the [CQTest Prerequisites](#cqtest-prerequisites), the macro creates our test object with a `TTestRunner` and an instance of the `InputAnimationTest`. Because the macro uses `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` as our base object, which is also derived from `ShooterTestsActorNetworkTest`, we get access to all of the member variables and methods provided by these objects. This will allow us to create our `TEST_METHOD` without the need to setup the `PlayerController` or any other components as the `virtual void Setup() override` will handle that for us.

The `InputAnimationTest` constructor is defined as a way to call the base object's constructor with an initializer list to provide the package path of the map to be loaded. This is due to the fact that the `ShooterTestsActorNetworkTest` handles loading of the map. This differs from the animation tests as those tests make use of the `FMapTestSpawner` to not only load the map, but also find our player character. The `FMapTestSpawner` has little use here as the `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` creates our PIE sessions and assigns the server and client worlds to the `FShooterTestsNetworkState`.

During the `ShooterTestsBaseActorNetworkTest::Setup()` is where the `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent<NetworkActorType> Network` is initialized and fetches players from both the server and client `UWorld`. As mentioned above, the `NetworkActorType` needs to be of type `FShooterTestsActorTestHelper` which is specified in the `ShooterTestsActorAnimationNetworkTest` definition when we provide the `FShooterTestsActorInputTestHelper` to our `Network` object. The tests will be ready once the `Network` object has initialized both the server and client states with their `UWorld` and both server and client players are loaded and spawned in all running PIE instances.

**Note that this process will take some time as both the world and assets need to be fully loaded across multiple PIE instances. This time increases as more clients connect which is why it was decided to limit clients to just 2.**

The above is accomplished by using the `TestCommandBuilder` with steps needed to ensure that the level and players are setup and ready prior to the test.

* Create the `PlaySettings` which will set the number of clients as well as our settings for the PIE sessions.
* Wait until all PIE sessions have been created and we are able to set both the server and client states with the proper `UWorld`.
  * All `UWorld` objects should have been created with a network driver.
  * The server `UWorld` will have its network driver marked as being the server.
  * We go through this step with an increased timeout duration as Lyra uses a loading screen to hide all of the PIE initialization.
* Wait until the server and clients have successfully connected to each other.
  * The server will have information about the number of clients currently connected which is checked against our expected client count.
  * The client will have a valid `ViewTarget` which tells us that the client is able to view the loaded level or that a PlayerController has been acknowledged.
* Then, mark the network component as actively running.
* Add a tear down step to end the PIE sessions when the test is done

At this point we have finished the steps that were provided `Start` of the `Network` object. At this point the server and client PIE sessions have been initialized and the level for each should be loaded. We still need to continue the `ShooterTestsBaseActorNetworkTest::Setup()` and fetch our players for the server and client and make sure that they are fully spawned in the `UWorld`. The steps here will get the players since each `TEST_METHOD` requires both the server and client players fully spawned to continue.

* On the server, wait until an owning PlayerController has been found
* Then, set the owning player controller as the local player in the server state
* Wait until the server player has finished playing their spawning effect to mark them as being fully spawned and ready
* On the client, wait until an owning PlayerController has been found
* Then, set the owning player controller as the local player in the client state
* Wait until the client player has finished playing their spawning effect to mark them as being fully spawned and ready

The above steps get both of the server and client player loaded and spawned within their PIE instance. Next we want to repeat the above steps but for each instances connecting player. This way we know that both the server and client are connected to each other and fully spawned so that we can begin our test.

* On the server, iterate through all of our `UWorld` players and find the player connected to us
* Repeat the above step, but on the client

With the `ShooterTestsBaseActorNetworkTest::Setup()` completed, the `TEST_METHOD` for the `InputAnimationTest` can be performed. Each `TEST_METHOD` will follow a similar process of using the `FShooterTestsNetworkComponent` to setup latent commands via the `TestCommandBuilder` to be executed using either the server or client state.

#### AbilitySpawnerMapTest

The **AbilitySpawnerMapTest** is a test object created from the macro `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS` and the implementation can be found in `/ShooterTests/Source/ShooterTestsRuntime/Private/ShooterTestsMapTests.cpp`. These test gameplay behavior is appropriately applied to the player `Pawn`.

The breakdown of the implementation is as follows:
We create our test object with the `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS` macro and the parameters `AbilitySpawnerMapTest`, `"Project.Functional Tests.ShooterTests.GameplayAbility"`, and we specify the flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter`. Because these tests are also spawning items to be used, we specify the flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter` to only run these tests within the Editor context.

The **AbilitySpawnerMapTest** object has additional variables specified to be use.

* `FMapTestSpawner` will spawn the test world for the player `Pawn` and other objects to be spawned into.
* `FCQTestBlueprintHelper` will assist with finding Blueprints for the objects which be used to create our `AActor* GameplayEffectPad`.
* `ALyraCharacter* Player` is the player `Pawn` in the world that the `GameplayEffect` will be applied to.
* `ULyraAbilitySystemComponent* AbilitySystemComponent` is where the information about the `Player` is stored and handled by.
* `const ULyraHealthSet* HealthSet` is where the information about the `Player` health is stored.

In addition to variables, there are also some methods implemented to help with our tests. `DoDamageToPlayer` is a method that takes in a `double` parameter used to apply as our `Player` damage. The method uses the `ULyraAssetManager` to then get the game data for the damage GameplayEffect and makes sure that the handle to the effect is valid. With a valid handle the call can then be made by the `AbilitySystemComponent` to specify the effect and the amount of damage to be applied.

The `SpawnGameplayPad` method takes a parameter for the name of the GameplayEffect. The method calls into `FCQTestBlueprintHelper::GetBlueprintClass` to look at the GameplayDirectory for the specified effect name and returns a `UClass` of the desired effect. Another call to `FCQTestBlueprintHelper::GetBlueprintClass` is done, but this time we are specifically looking for the `UClass` of the GameplayEffect pad. Using the `TObjectBuilder`, we spawn an `AActor` of the GameplayEffect pad with the class of the desired effect to spawn with.

The final method, `IsPlayerDamaged`, just checks to see if the current health is less than the max allowed health.

With the variables and methods supplied by this object, we can now start going into the methods which will describe the flow of the tests. First is the `BEFORE_EACH` which goes through and prepares the level for the test by using the `FMapTestSpawner` to specify our level location and name before waiting until the level has been loaded. Once the level is loaded the `TestCommandBuilder` is then used to build the steps needed to ensure that the level is setup prior to the test.

* Start when we are able to find a valid player `Pawn`. The default timeout is 10 seconds, but **Lyra** uses a loading screen to load additional objects. Because of this we increase the timeout to 30 seconds.
* Do, set the `Player` found from `FMapTestSpawner::FindFirstPlayerPawn`. We also make sure that the `AbilitySystemComponent` is valid and that `HealthSet` is set to the max possible health.

After the `BEFORE_EACH`, we then have `TEST_METHOD` that can be run:
**PlayerOnDamageSpawner_Eventually_LosesHealth**
Uses the `TestCommandBuilder` to build steps that will check that the `Player` loses health when the damage GameplayEffect is spawned.

* Start when the `AbilitySystemComponent` can find the gameplay tag for `TAG_Gameplay_DamageImmunity`
* Then, call the method `SpawnGameplayPad` to spawn our GameplayPad with the damage GameplayEffect.
* Run until we see that the player has been damaged by the effect, `IsPlayerDamaged`.

**PlayerMissingHealth_OnHealSpawner_RestoresHealth**
Uses the `TestCommandBuilder` to build steps that will check that the `Player` loses health when the heal GameplayEffect is spawned.

* Start when the `AbilitySystemComponent` can find the gameplay tag for `TAG_Gameplay_DamageImmunity`
* Then, call the method `DoDamageToPlayer` to apply 10 points of damage directly to our `Player`.
* Run until we see that the player has been damaged by the effect, `IsPlayerDamaged`.
* Then, call the method `SpawnGameplayPad` to spawn our GameplayPad with the healing GameplayEffect.
* Run until we see that the player has been healed by the effect by checking that our player has not been damaged, `!IsPlayerDamaged`.

### Blueprint Functional Tests

The **Shooter Tests** plugin has a few Blueprint functional tests which can be found in `/GameFeatures/ShooterTests/Content/Blueprint`. These tests can be viewed within the Blueprint Editor to help get a better understanding of how the tests are setup and what nodes they are using to accomplish testing the functionality. Please note that when viewing these tests from the **Automation** tab of the **Session Frontend**, the Blueprint Functional Test will reside under the name of the Level. For example, the test [B_Test_AutoRun](#b_test_autorun) will be located under the level name of `L_ShooterTest_Autorun` and clicking on the test itself will open the level unless the Editor already has the level opened. Some of the tests implemented using a Blueprint Functional Test Actor:

* [B_Test_AutoRun](#b_test_autorun)
* [B_Test_FireWeapon](#b_test_fireweapon)

Please see [the online documentation on Blueprint Functional Tests](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/functional-testing-in-unreal-engine) for more information about how to get get started with creating tests of what a Blueprint Functional Test Actor is.

#### B_Test_AutoRun

The **B_Test_AutoRun** Blueprint Functional Test is setup to check that the **Hero** `Lyra Player Controller` can have the `Input Action` for auto run enabled. Opening up and viewing this Blueprint within the Editor will help show the following:
* How to setup the `Event Start Test` event as the main test entry point
* Using assertion nodes to validate conditions and behaviors
* Creating and triggering of custom events
* Use of Delays to allow other latent commands to execute
* Setting and getting of private Blueprint Function Variables
* Working with Blueprint Components (**Target Point**)
* Working with the local PlayerController to inject input
* Performing checks on every `Event Tick` to validate a successful test condition
* Using functionality to check overlaps between actors

#### B_Test_FireWeapon

The **B_Test_FireWeapon** Blueprint Functional Test is setup to check that the **Hero** has ammo for their starting weapon and upon firing, validates that the weapon has successfully fired by checking if the ammo count has decreased. Opening up and viewing this Blueprint within the Editor will help show the following:
* How to setup the `Event Start Test` event as the main test entry point
* Using Blueprint Macros for reusability
* Using assertion nodes to validate conditions and behaviors
* Creating and triggering of custom events
* Use of Delays to allow other latent commands to execute
* Working with the local PlayerController to inject input

## Troubleshooting Lyra automated tests

This section mentions some common pitfalls discovered when creating automated tests within the **Lyra** project.

### Cannot use a new map for a network test
By default **Lyra** requires a network to be created by going through the front-end and providing an experience to be loaded. For most testing scenarios we will want to have the network created with the level we want without the need to mimic going through the typical **Lyra** front-end menus. To adjust this, load the map within the Editor and right-click the `UWorld` within the `Outliner`. A context menu will appear where one of the options will be `World Settings`. Clicking on the `World Settings` option will open a `World Settings` panel. Within the panel search for the `PIE` category where there will be a checkbox enabled for `Force Standalone Net Mode`. Disabling this and saving the `UWorld` will allow for networks to be created without the need to go through the **Lyra** front-end.

### Tests are flaky due to each test run spawning a random character
There are 2 different character models that are spawned in a **Lyra** session, Manny and Quinn. By default these characters are spawned randomly and testing for certain functionality, such as animations, could cause flakiness as each character has a different animation layer associated with them. The following steps should be done in order to forcefully load a specific character, or to have character loading handled in a deterministic manner:
* In the Content Browser, navigate to `/Content/Characters/Cosmetics`
  * This directory not only has the 2 character models, but there you will find 2 Blueprint Classes, `B_PickRandomCharacter` and `B_CharacterSelection`
  * By default, `B_PickRandomCharacter` is invoked on the `ALyraPlayerController` to select a random model when spawning
  * `B_CharacterSelection` is more deterministic in that it loads the model using a round robin approach starting with `B_Manny`, then `B_Quinn`, before going back to `B_Manny`
* Either duplicate the `B_PickRandomCharacter` or `B_CharacterSelection` Blueprint or create a new Blueprint Class with the `Lyra Controller Component Character Parts` as the parent class
* Modify the `Event Graph` of the new blueprint to load the character you wish to test with and make sure to compile and save when done.
* Back in the Content Browser, navigate to `/Plugins/ShooterTests Content/System/Experiences`
  * This directory has 2 Blueprint Classes, `B_BasicShooterTest` and `B_AutomatedShooterTest`
* * Either duplicate the `B_BasicShooterTest` or `B_AutomatedShooterTest` Blueprint or create a new Blueprint Class with the `Lyra Experience Definition` as the parent class
* Under the `Class Defaults` section navigate to the `Actions` category and expand both the `Actions` category and the `Actions` item.
* Add or expand the `Add Components` element
* Add or replace the `Engine.Controller` script with the Blueprint that was created above before compiling and saving the Blueprint
* Go back to the Editor and open up the `World Settings` of the world
  * Follow the steps above on how to access the `World Settings` panel
* In the `World Settings` panel, search for the `Default Gameplay Experience` under the `Game Mode` category and select the newly created experience Blueprint
